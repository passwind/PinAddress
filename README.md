PinAddress
==========

A program used to get GPS and take photo for an address.

Just a practice with CoreData and Storyboard. Of course, there is something about CoreLocation and UIImagePickerController.

But I think it's interesting and confused to use relationship between entities. If "Delete Rule" is set to "Cascade", maybe something occurs!!
